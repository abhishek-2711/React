# Optimizing our app

    - single responsibility principle
    - modulairty - break down code into different chunks so that your code can be testable.

    - hook - utility function 
    - take out some responsiblity from function and put it into custom hook 
    - Lazy Loading, dynamic bundling, on demand loading, code splitting, chunking -> all refers to same process
